# Ensure Immutability of Containers at Runtime

In this section, we will take a look at how to Ensure Immutability of Containers at Runtime

-  Although containers are meant to be immutable by default, we can carry out in-place updates on them.

- Now, this can be done in a number of different ways â€“ such as copying files directly in to the pod or getting a shell in to the container and making changes e.t.c.

      docker cp nginx.conf nginx:/etc/nginx

    Or

      kubectl exec -it nginx -- apt update

- To prevent this, make sure that we cannot write to the file system once the pod is started.

- To do this we can use **`security contexts`** with **`readOnlyRootFilesystem=true`**


### Nginx with readOnlyRootFilesystem=true to ensure the immutability

nginx.yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx
      name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        securityContext:
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        volumeMounts:
        - name: cache-volume
          mountPath: /var/cache/nginx
        - name: runtime-volume
          mountPath: /var/run
      volumes:
        - name: cache-volume
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: runtime-volume
          emptyDir: {}

  create the nginx.ayml

      kubectl create -f nginx.yaml


  test immutability

    kubectl exec -it nginx -- apt update
